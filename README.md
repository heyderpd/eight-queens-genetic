# Eight Queens Problem

The problem consists in place eight queens in a chess board so that no queen can be attacked by the other seven.

In this repository I present a solution using a genetic algorithm that stops as soon as it finds a configuration that solves the problem, and displays it in a window.

It is implemented in Java and uses no library but the default java api.
